# CRT Terminal Emulator

Run a `[fake]` CRT Terminal in the browser. Reminds me of the old days of dumb terminals, green screens, and slow response times!

I was thinking about building a game with this some day but for now you can get an idea of how it would work. There is nothing but HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript in this puppy.

Enjoy!
